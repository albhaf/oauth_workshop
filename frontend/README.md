# Getting Started

You can start the frontend in two ways:
* With `yarn` and a local install of `node 14`:
    * `yarn install`
    * `yarn start`
* Using Docker:
    * `docker compose up` / `docker-compose up`

The app listens on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
